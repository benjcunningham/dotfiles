dotfiles
========

Hey, these are my dotfiles. You probably shouldn't use them, but you're very welcome to try. Just be careful, since they might not do what you expect. And this website? It's documentation for those dotfiles, and more generally how I setup my machines. It's all a bit excessive, but maybe you'll find it as useful as I do.

By the way, the source of this project is on `GitHub <https://github.com/benjcunningham/dotfiles>`_.

Features
--------

I use these dotfiles on multiple machines, work and personal. Some things aren't exactly the same across different systems, but there is a lot of standardization. Here are the highlights:
