These are my dotfiles. If you'd like to learn more about them, check out the
nice project documentation I've written at
[benjcunningham.org/dotfiles](https://benjcunningham.org/dotfiles/). Thanks!

## Installation

All installation is driven by `install.sh`. It is designed for quick, easy
install on a fresh machine via:

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/benjcunningham/dotfiles/install.sh
bash install.sh [OPTIONS]

# OPTIONS
#
#   -h  Show usage and help for program.
#   -l  Specify that the dotfiles repository is already available on the
#       local host.
#   -p  Specify that Brewfile.personal should be installed.
#   -w  Specify that Brewfile.work should be installed.
```

**Note:** You should make sure to verify the contents of the script you
download matches the contents of the file at
https://github.com/benjcunningham/dotfiles/install.sh before executing it.
